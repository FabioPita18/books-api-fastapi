This package contains business logic services that are:
- Separate from HTTP handling (routers)
- Reusable across different parts of the application
- Easier to test in isolation

Current services:
- cache.py: Redis caching utilities (placeholder for now)
- rate_limit.py: Rate limiting logic (placeholder for now)
